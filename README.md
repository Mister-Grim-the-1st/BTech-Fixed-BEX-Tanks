All credit goes to LordRuthermore for the bulk of the work. 

I only got a few of the final things working and fixed a small bug or two.

Best if used on a new save. 
It won't break your save, but you may run into problems with not being able to train abilities to your existing pilots.
This includes your Commander. 
It should be able to be fixed by the save editor by adding tags/quirks to the affected pilots.

To pilot a mech and learn Mech skills the pilot needs the:                              pilot_mech_pilot      tag.
To pilot a vehicle and learn Vehicle skills the pilot needs the:                        pilot_vehicle_crew    tag.
And if you want your vehicle pilot to be unable to pilot mechs they will need the:      pilot_nomech_crew     tag.

To Do: 

make skills Vehicle exlusive, IE Mech skills can only be used while piloting Mechs and vice versa.
